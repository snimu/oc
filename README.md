# opencode-rlm

[Recursive Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601) plugin for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai). Records the full conversation trajectory to disk, enriches context compaction with history, and gives the LM a scratch directory and system prompt for recursive problem-solving.

## What it does

- **Tracks full RLM history without discarding information** — appends every turn to `active/trajectory.json` so nothing is lost on compaction
- **Summarizes when root LM is full, but history still available in JSON** — injects past trajectory summaries into the compaction prompt so the continuation summary is RLM-aware
- **Scratch directory** — provides `vars/` for the LM to persist plans, notes, and intermediates across compaction boundaries
- **System prompt for recursion** — tells the LM about its trajectory file, vars directory, and `opencode run` for spawning subtasks

Also provide a `/context` command for the user to view the current active history (on disk) + the LM's current context. Looks something like this:

## Installation

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) and [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai).

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd opencode-rlm
bun install
```

Register in `opencode.json` (project root) or `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (global):

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["file:///absolute/path/to/opencode-rlm"]
}
```

## Session directory layout

```
/tmp/rlm-opencode-<hash>/
  active/
    trajectory.json    # Full trajectory log (read-only for the LM)
  vars/                # Scratch directory (LM reads/writes freely)
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `RLM_BASE_DIR` | `/tmp` | Base directory for session directories |
| `RLM_CLEANUP_ON_DELETE` | `false` | Delete session dir when session is deleted |
| `RLM_MAX_TOOL_OUTPUT_CHARS` | `50000` | Max chars to store per tool result in trajectory |
| `RLM_TOKEN_ESTIMATE_MULTIPLIER` | `1.0` | Tuning multiplier for token estimation |
